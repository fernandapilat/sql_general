# SQL Learning

This repository serves as a comprehensive technical portfolio documenting my progression in SQL, ranging from foundational logic to complex data analysis and structural database modeling.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into five specialized modules, designed to showcase different levels of database mastery:

| Directory | Level | Focus | Key Topics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0_exercises** | Practice | Problem Solving | HackerRank Challenges & Window Functions |
| **01_course_intermediate** | Intermediate | Practical SQL | Conditional Logic, Aggregations & Reports |
| **02_course_advanced** | Advanced | Database Integrity | Complex Joins, Views & ACID Transactions |
| **03_course_data_analysis** | Specialized | Business Intelligence | Time Series, Seasonality & Sales Trends |
| **04_course_data_modeling** | Specialized | Architecture | Database Design & Structural Relationships |

## Technical Competencies

### 1. Advanced Analytical SQL
* Mastery of **Window Functions** (`RANK`, `LEAD/LAG`, `OVER`) for row-by-row analytical calculations.
* Complex data manipulation using **CTEs** (Common Table Expressions) and **Subqueries**.
* Data pivoting and segmentation using conditional logic (`CASE WHEN`).

### 2. Database Objects & Integrity
* Implementation of **Views** for query simplification and **Triggers** for automation.
* Management of **ACID Transactions** to ensure data consistency and reliability.
* Structural definition using **DDL** (Data Definition Language).

### 3. Business Insights & Analysis
* Development of **Business Reports** focusing on performance metrics (KPIs).
* **Seasonality Analysis** (e.g., Black Friday trends) and historical variance calculations.
* **Descriptive Statistics** applied to sales and academic datasets.

### 4. Data Modeling (In Progress/New)
* Focus on designing scalable database structures and understanding entity relationships.

## Technologies
* **Engines**: MySQL, SQLite e Snowflake.
* **Methodologies**: Relational Modeling, Set Theory, Time Series Analysis.
