# **History of SQL**
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard language for interacting with relational databases. Its history is deeply tied to the development of relational databases and the advancement of data storage and manipulation technologies.

## **1. Origin of the Relational Concept (1970)**
- The concept of the relational database was introduced by Edgar F. Codd, an IBM scientist, in a seminal paper published in 1970 titled "A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks."
- This theoretical model proposed the use of tables to store data and defined the foundation for SQL.

## **2. Initial Development of SQL (1974–1979)**
- IBM began creating a relational database prototype called System R to demonstrate the viability of the relational model.
- During the System R project, the language SEQUEL (Structured English Query Language) was developed to allow interaction with the stored data.
- Subsequently, the name was changed to SQL, as "SEQUEL" was a registered trademark.

## **3. SQL Becomes a Standard (1986–1987)**
- In 1986, the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standardized SQL, consolidating it as the standard language for manipulating relational databases.
- One year later, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) also adopted SQL as a standard.

## **4. Popularization of SQL (The 1980s)**
- With the emergence of database systems like Oracle Database (1979), IBM Db2 (1983), and Microsoft SQL Server (1989), SQL gained popularity in the commercial market.
- It became widely adopted due to its simplicity, flexibility, and power in data manipulation.

## **5. Advancements and Extensions of SQL (1990–Present)**
- SQL has undergone several revisions and enhancements, such as:
    - **SQL-92:** Introduced advanced features like subqueries and new data types.
    - **SQL:1999:** Added support for object-oriented programming and triggers.
    - **SQL:2003:** Included XML and **Window Functions**.
    - **SQL:2011:** Introduced support for temporal data.
>Over the years, specific implementations such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite further popularized SQL, making it essential for developers and data administrators.

## **6. SQL Today**
- SQL is widely used across almost all modern relational database systems.
- Although NoSQL has gained traction for certain use cases, SQL continues to be one of the most used and relevant languages in the field of data management.

## **Curiosity**
SQL was designed to closely resemble the English language, facilitating its adoption by non-technical users and making it one of the most intuitive query languages.

## **Conclusion**
The history of SQL reflects its evolution from a theoretical concept to an indispensable tool in the world of data. It remains at the heart of many modern technologies and continues to evolve with market demands.
