# SQL Advanced

This module contains the practical and theoretical content developed during the course **Consultas SQL: avançando no SQL with MySQL**, provided by **Alura**.

The course focuses on the evolution of SQL queries within the MySQL environment, covering everything from the structure of complex filters to the use of data manipulation functions, database objects, and the creation of decision-support reports.

## Folder Organization

The file structure is organized to separate theory, learning queries, and final reports:

* **notes/**: Documentation and theoretical notes on the concepts covered in each class.
* **queries/**: Executable SQL scripts, numbered according to the curriculum progression.
* **reports/**: Scripts focused on consolidated queries for business data analysis.
