# Data Modeling Course

This repository serves as a centralized hub for all my data modeling studies, following the complete track from conceptual design to physical implementation using the **Flexempresta** case study.

## Learning Path

| Module | Phase | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **01** | [Conceptual Modeling](./01_conceptual_model/) | Business rules, entities, attributes, and ER Diagrams (DER). |
| **02** | [Logical Modeling](./02_logical_model/) | Relational mapping, Primary Keys (PK), and Foreign Keys (FK). |
| **03** | [Normalization](./03_normalization/) | Optimization through 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF to ensure data integrity. |
| **04** | [Physical Modeling](./04_physical_model/) | SGBD implementation, SQL DDL scripts, and database construction. |
