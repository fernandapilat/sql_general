# SQL Intermediate

This module contains the practical development and study materials from the course **Realizando Consultas SQL: Joins, Views e Transações**, provided by **Alura**.

The course focuses on advanced data manipulation, exploring complex table relationships, the use of subqueries, database object management (Views and Triggers), and the fundamental concepts of ACID transactions.

## Folder Organization

The files in this directory are organized by execution order and topic, including databases and reference materials:

* **SQL Scripts**: Numbered from 00 to 11, covering the entire curriculum from table creation to complex exercises.
* **Databases**: Includes SQLite sample databases (`retail.db` and `school.db`) and CSV datasets.
* **Reference**: A PDF glossary for quick technical consultation.
